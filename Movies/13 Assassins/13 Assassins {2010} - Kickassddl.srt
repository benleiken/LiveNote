1
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,639
As feudal Japan enjoys peace,
the samurai era is waning.

2
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,808
But this fragile calm is threatened
by the growing power of Lord Naritsugu,

3
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,311
the Shogun's sadistic younger brother.

4
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,856
Sir Doi realizes
Naritsugu will ruin the Shogunate

5
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,983
if he gains higher political standing.

6
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,486
As Naritsugu's evil deeds
are quickly hushed up, Sir Doi must act.

7
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,578


8
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,334


9
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,504


10
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,302


11
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,472

12
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,687


13
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,323


14
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:02,556
March 5, 1844 - Akashi CIan House EIder
zusho Mamiya commits harakiri.

15
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:08,562
Mamiya's harakiri to the Shogun
was against Lord Naritsugu.

16
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,607
Lord Naritsugu was born
with a vicious nature.

17
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:17,988
His lust for flesh and dishonorable
conduct cannot be pardoned.

18
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,990
What should we do?

19
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:25,204
Man: Shogun Council Elders,
Sir Doi has returned.

20
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:49,061
The Shogun orders us to settle
the matter of his half-brother quietly.

21
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:54,107
SIR DOI
Top Shogun official

22
00:03:54,275 --> 00:04:01,031
We blame those that named Naritsugu
an adopted Akashi son.

23
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,953
This dilemma drove Mamiya
to harakiri.

24
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,749
- His appeal to us for action...
- l'm aware of that!

25
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:16,713
But we must respect
the Shogun's rule.

26
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,260
His justice is noble
by heaven's will.

27
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:26,056
Arguing is pointless!

28
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:36,441
13 ASSASSlNS

29
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,779


30
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,911


31
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:59,548
Shinzaemon Shimada,
l presume?

32
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,300
ln the flesh.

33
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,261


34
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,346
You're a hard man to find.

35
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,816
Sir Doi.

36
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,320
Sorry for the late hour.

37
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:25,741
l've been a widower for years,
with few family obligations.

38
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,493
SHINZAEMON
Shogun Samurai

39
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:33,915
Perhaps you've heard
about the outrage.

40
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,918
l have.

41
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,923
So...

42
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,262
what do you
make of Lord Naritsugu?

43
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:55,020
Forgive my frankness...

44
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,358
he is no worthy heir
to the noble Akashi clan.

45
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:05,697
With the Shogun's consent,
l suggest Naritsugu steps down.

46
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,700
A more suitable heir is needed.

47
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:13,205
The Shogun will not grant it.

48
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,416
Why not?

49
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:24,383
He has appointed Naritsugu
as his senior advisor,

50
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,261
effective on Naritsugu's
next visit to Edo.

51
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:34,059
The Shogun will allow that boy
to meddle in political affairs?

52
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:40,023
lncidentally,
l invited someone here.

53
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,693
Speak with him.

54
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:03,046
l'm Yukie Makino,
a subject of the Lord of Owari.

55
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,424
l serve the Agematsu in Kiso.

56
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,717
l'm Shinzaemon Shimada.

57
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,595
Kiso?

58
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:17,060
l heard about an incident last year
between the Akashi and Owari clans.

59
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,229
Rumors of a scandal...

60
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:24,443
l'll tell you all.
l'll keep no secrets.

61
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,486


62
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,697
Makino:
In April of last year...

63
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,450


64
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:36,872
Lord Naritsugu
of the Akashi cIan...

65
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,043
stayed overnight at Kiso.

66
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,550
He is the son
of the former Shogun.

67
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,218
LORD NARlTSUGU
Akashi Clan ruler

68
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,888
Nobility must be properly served.

69
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:58,560
Our wives and daughters were
brought in for his full hospitality.

70
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,319
Uneme.

71
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,321
Father.

72
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,656
- ls his feast in order?
- Yes.

73
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,576
And the picture scrolls
for his entertainment?

74
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,161
l'll fetch them.

75
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,413
Have your wife
get them instead.

76
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,207


77
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,421
Chise.

78
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:34,095
Makino: My son had married Chise
onIy two months prior.

79
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,015
I ordered her
to do this petty task.

80
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:42,521
And I'll regret it to my grave.

81
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,945
Naritsugu:
Who might you be?

82
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:54,491
l belong
to the Uneme Makino family.

83
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,161


84
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:02,499

My Lord, please release me.

85
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,835


86
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,712


87
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,508


88
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,263
Chise!

89
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,017
Chise?

90
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,812
Chise?!

91
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:32,279


92
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,792
- Chise?

93
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,962
Naritsugu: Kiso women
are such mountain monkeys.

94
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:53,300
They defy me by scratching.

95
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,639


96
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,560
Are you a monkey too, servant?

97
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:16,698
Chise.

98
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,577
Uneme:
Chise!

99
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,288


100
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:29,044


101
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,009


102
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,476

103
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,152

104
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,531
Monkey necks can be so tough.

105
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,749
Makino:
That same night...

106
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:13,004
Chise slit her throat in disgrace.

107
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,674


108
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,010
Makino:
My son and his new bride slain...

109
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:23,765
before my very eyes.

110
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,978
This is torture.

111
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:35,276
Rather than living in disgrace
l ponder harakiri.

112
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:40,824
But l can't... l remember the shame
my Lord Owari has endured.

113
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,621

Mock me for grumbling.

114
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,542
l continue my worthless life

115
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,753
solely to remain a living witness
to this tragedy.

116
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:02,429
Sir Doi: As the Council Elder
enacting the Shogun's justice...

117
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,642
some things l can do,
others l cannot.

118
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:15,233
lf l turn my back on the Shogun
and find fault with his lineage,

119
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:22,699
then his rule will spiral into chaos
and destroy years of peace.

120
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,499
As the Shogun's senior advisor,
l cannot do it.

121
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:39,090
Are you asking
if l can do something?

122
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,928
Since Mamiya's harakiri protest
three days ago...

123
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:49,184
l've searched my soul
for a solution.

124
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:59,652
l have decided it's you.

125
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,055
Who's the woman?

126
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:32,101
Sir Doi: Akashi land
was once most fertiIe.

127
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:38,191
But Naritsugu's
reIentIess Iand taxes

128
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:43,696
made starving peasants
hunger for revolt.

129
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,950
This woman...

130
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:52,789
is the daughter
of the peasant leader.

131
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,002


132
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,550
Sir Doi:
He did this.

133
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:10,265
He cut off her Iimbs.

134
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:16,104
And brought her to Edo
as his plaything.

135
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:22,360
But he grew bored with her
and cast her out.

136
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,821


137
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,870
ls there no mercy?

138
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,498


139
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:44,966
Shinzaemon, l need not mention
my honor and position.

140
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:52,181
lf this continues, chaos will ruin
our nation and the people will suffer.

141
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:02,150
Poor woman...
what of your family's fate?

142
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,697


143
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,372


144
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,588
He cut out her tongue as well.

145
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,552


146
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,566
Shinzaemon's voice:
"TotaI massacre."

147
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:51,157


148
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,787


149
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,001
How fate smiles on me.

150
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:06,965


151
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:11,803
As a samurai
in this era of peace...

152
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,306
l've been wishing
for a noble death.

153
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,102
Now fate has called me here.

154
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:28,820
See, my hands won't stop
trembling.

155
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,326
Hmm...

156
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:39,914
lt's a warrior's battle shakes.

157
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,461


158
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,190
l will accomplish your wish...

159
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,235
with magnificence.

160
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,403


161
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,239
Sir Hanbei,
thank you for coming.

162
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,782
HANBEI
Naritsugu's Chief Samurai

163
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,494
- Asakawa, where's Lord Naritsugu?
- ln the banquet hall.

164
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,289


165
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,041
( dull thump,
woman screams )

166
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,876
The Mamiya?

167
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,756
l told you not to trouble
the Mamiya family!

168
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,884
Asakawa: l can't disobey
Lord Naritsugu's orders.

169
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,262


170
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,606


171
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,484


172
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,860
Tsk.

173
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,904

My Lord!

174
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,699
Yes, Hanbei?

175
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:01,746
Sir Doi has humbly requested
that you leave the Mamiya family alone.

176
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,248
Governmental orders!

177
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:08,294
Doi again!
That grumbling Shogun advisor.

178
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,506
Lord Naritsugu!

179
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,382


180
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,265
Naritsugu:
What makes a samurai warrior?

181
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:27,146
You men mindlessly chant
"loyalty, duty"...

182
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,315
like a Buddhist prayer.

183
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:32,860
But if servants are spoiled,

184
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:36,364
then one day, they forget
their duty to serve.

185
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:41,452
Servants like Mamiya make light
of their master and revolt.

186
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,291
Punishing one's servants,

187
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,461
who are certified as property
by the Shogun...

188
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,799
punishment is a master's duty.

189
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:04,142
Dying for one's master
is the way of the samurai.

190
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,729
Dying for one's husband
is the way of women.

191
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,648
( woman groans,
bowstring creaks )

192
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,276


193
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,444


194
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:25,746
We must protect these ways,
right, Hanbei?

195
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,877
Yes.

196
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,797
Hanbei: They won't let him
get away with it.

197
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:38,843
Things worked out too easiIy
for our Lord, don't you think?

198
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,721
Asakawa:
He was given special treatment.

199
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:48,394
Though born of a different mother,
he is still the Shogun's brother.

200
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,357
Hanbei:
So how will Sir Doi save face?

201
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:58,487
As the man in charge
of the nation's justice...

202
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:05,411
he must deIiver a verdict to save
his honor in a scandaI Iike this.

203
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,417
So, Sir Doi is plotting something?

204
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,045

Who goes there?

205
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,214


206
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:20,259
Attendant Deguchi at your service.

207
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:26,933
Hanbei:
Gather men and spy on Sir Doi.

208
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,100


209
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,770
Bribe the gatekeepers and servants.

210
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:37,235
Get his list of visitors
since Mamiya's harakiri.

211
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,403


212
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,617

We protect our Lord at all costs.

213
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,456
Such is our duty.

214
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,754
Yukie Makino of the Owari clan?

215
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,383
Owari?

216
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,385
Makino?

217
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:06,597
Makino was present
during our Kiso visit.

218
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:12,561
Hanbei:
So Makino met with Shinzaemon.

219
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:17,316
Asakawa:
Do you know this Shinzaemon?

220
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:23,906
We attended the same school, even
trained in the sword at the same dojo.

221
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,201
We were competitive classmates.

222
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,578
ls he that skilled?

223
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:34,375
He's not as shrewd, not as strong.

224
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,169
But he never gives up.

225
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:42,258
Backed into a corner, he won't budge.
Won't overplay his hand.

226
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:47,054
He's a man who beats you
in the end.

227
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,976
lf Doi has picked him...

228
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:58,107
then we've drawn the worst luck.

229
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,904


230
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:29,221
Shinzaemon:
lmpressive as always, Hirayama.

231
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:35,102
l'm sorry for always borrowing
your dojo without permission.

232
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:41,734
You honor me by using it.
Your spirit keeps the dojo alive.

233
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,529
A match for old time's sake?

234
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:50,868
Hirayama: Better to save our energy
for bigger tasks, right?

235
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:56,791
There are no big or small tasks.
All are equally important.

236
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,509
You follow me?

237
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,472
Guess you still lack training.


238
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,978
Since your teaching, l have been
on the path of the sword for 10 years.

239
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:23,526
As the months
and seasons changed...

240
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:27,613
l lived on the money you gave me
as a sword for hire...

241
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:32,993
knowing that, one day,
l'd surrender my life to you.

242
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,458
l thought a time would come
when l could repay you.

243
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:45,798
Yet l have no choice
but to regret...

244
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:50,761
l have not been
able to repay you yet, master.

245
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,435
Shinzaemon:
Your appreciation.

246
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,939
My small contribution
means so much?

247
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,152
l thank you.

248
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:10,156
Man: What a rare samurai
in these times!

249
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:13,492
Shinzaemon:
Oh, Kuranaga!

250
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,121
l'm Hirayama.

251
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,791
Kuranaga:
We can't waste his spirit.

252
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,461
Have him join us.

253
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,382
Shinzaemon:
Hmm.

254
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:38,058
l chose five of my men.
They await you inside.

255
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:47,902
Kuranaga: Mitsuhashi,
get acquainted with Hirayama.

256
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:54,742
l am Mitsuhashi,
at your service.

257
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:03,250
Kuranaga: l present my subordinates,
Otake and Hioki.

258
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:08,172
Mitsuhashi:
And my men, Higuchi and Horii.

259
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,343
Hand-picked from hundreds.

260
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:16,555
Kuranaga:
We are still few.

261
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:22,311
It's hard to find skiIIed samurai
in this day and age.

262
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:28,359
Others are samurai of IittIe worth.

263
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:35,032
Our five lives are in your hands,
Sir Shinzaemon.

264
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,535
l see.

265
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:44,708
Then listen up.
By private order of Sir Doi...

266
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:51,549
we've been assigned to take the life
of Lord Naritsugu of the Akashi clan.

267
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:03,269
Next month, Naritsugu will leave Edo
for the Akashi domain.

268
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:08,107
lf he enters Akashi land,
we can't touch him.

269
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,734
Hirayama:
So we strike en route?

270
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:17,241
That's the plan. lt's absurd
with so little time and few men.

271
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:24,540
But these days, how many samurai
use their swords in actual battle?

272
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:29,628
Not them, not us.
A real challenge.

273
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,883
He who values his life
dies a dog's death.

274
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,804
You've entrusted me
with your lives.

275
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,433
l'll spend them...

276
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,935
at my discretion.

277
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,276
Shinzaemon's voice:
Now, we are nine.

278
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,611


279
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:59,450
How many other
true samurai are Ieft?

280
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,246
Hioki:
l'll take my leave.

281
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,898
Man:
What was that meeting?

282
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,151
Hioki:
Akashi samurai?

283
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,446
Man:
Now you know!

284
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,666


285
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,925
How dare you point your sword
at us, novice!

286
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,593
Who are you?

287
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,595
State your name.

288
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:05,516
Hirayama. l'm a ronin.

289
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:13,273
He killed our sword masters
in one slice.

290
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:19,530
l won't permit
such blatant moves again.

291
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:23,033
lf Sir Doi so wishes,
the coals we once cooled...

292
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:27,538
will ignite into a blaze
burning down our clan!

293
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:31,166
Forgive me
for my thoughtless act.

294
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:36,547
Now it's clear.
lt is Shinzaemon.

295
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,008
Man:
Place your bets.

296
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,928
Gambler:
Odd or even.

297
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,765


298
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:55,399
Odd.

299
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,197
Lady Luck is with you.

300
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,991
Don't talk to me.

301
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,659
What?

302
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,495
Luck leaves
when unlucky men talk.

303
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,796


304
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,973


305
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:33,103
Shogun retainer Shimada's
third son.

306
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,271


307
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:38,734
Samurai are always asking
to borrow money.

308
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:42,488
My shop is full
of pawned swords.

309
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:47,326
These days, swords are
only good for cutting radishes.

310
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,037


311
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,999
Whoa!


312
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,961


313
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,381
Man:
Well, hello Uncle!

314
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:09,848
Womanizing at your age
is bad form, don't you think?

315
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:18,565
Bravo Nephew!
You young rogue.

316
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:26,073
Sake bought with gambling money
tastes best.

317
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,325
Spare me the irony.

318
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:33,330
Gambling is the only time
l feel alive.

319
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:38,043
Samurai status
doesn't suit me.

320
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:42,464
l too hated being a samurai,
but then l realized...

321
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:47,386
l could never be a true player
by playing around.

322
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,932
A true player
doesn't try so hard.

323
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,561
l'm not trying too hard.

324
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,688
l wonder.

325
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,942
How's your girl?

326
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,071
Well...

327
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,576
she hasn't kicked me out yet.

328
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,286


329
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,788
Be yourself.
But don't overdo it!

330
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,957


331
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,256
Lords are making
their annual trips home.

332
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,301
Shouldn't you be busy?

333
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:32,097
Work is my excuse
to gamble too.

334
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:37,519
l'm on a mission,
a long shot.

335
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,026
Will that gamble pay off?

336
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:50,490
Pay off? lt's like walking
through the eye of a needle.

337
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,411
Quit while you're ahead.

338
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,623

You're clever.

339
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:03,795
But your uncle is a born fool.
l go for broke and bet it all.

340
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,425
And if you win?

341
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,971
lf, by chance, l win...

342
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,726
in time, someone
might appreciate me.

343
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,062
Maybe.

344
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,022


345
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:29,488
Betting on yourself is true gambling.
Who's overdoing it now?

346
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,823


347
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,704
l'll say this, Shinrokuro.

348
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:45,545
My gamble is more exciting than yours,
with the same odds.

349
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:01,228
Woman:
Shinrokuro, are you home?

350
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:15,409
You tease.
lf you're here, say so.

351
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:23,083
Shinrokuro:
I'm neither here nor there.

352
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:27,254
No teasing. You're right here.

353
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,510
Shinrokuro:
I saw my uncle.

354
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,889
Sir Shinzaemon?

355
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:41,018
Yes.

356
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:52,988
What's wrong?
Did something happen?

357
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,705
Tsuya...

358
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,960
No.

359
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,968
Don't.

360
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,228
Shinrokuro.

361
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,731
l'll be gone for a while.

362
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:39,618
When will you return?

363
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:46,666
Soon.
But if l'm late...

364
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,547
l'll be at the Festival
of the Dead.

365
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,179
Burn the honorary torch
and wait.

366
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:15,487
This is my one and only pupil.

367
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:18,365
Ogura at your service.

368
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,536
Shinzaemon:
Are your parents still alive?

369
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:30,085
Father died two years ago;
Mother passed when l was five.

370
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:36,550
l come from a lowly family
serving a noble's concubine.

371
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:41,388
Since deciding to live for the sword,
l've waited for this day...

372
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,474
to use my skills for society.

373
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,522
Allow me to join you.

374
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,192
Hirayama:
l request that you take him too.

375
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,821
But he's too young.

376
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:04,244
Shinzaemon, you're wrong.
Devotion knows no age.

377
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:09,082
A samurai's life isn't measured
in length, is it?

378
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,879
My logic was shallow.

379
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,425
May we ask your help?

380
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,053
Thank you very much!

381
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,806
l will surrender my life
to serve you.

382
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:29,853
And who might you be?

383
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:35,192
Sahara, a lowly ronin...

384
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,112
with no redeeming merit
but my spear.

385
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,240
- Hirayama: l vouch only for his skill.

386
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,659
Hirayama told me
of your mission.

387
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:50,790
Fighting a larger enemy is admirable.
l very much want to join but...

388
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,378
one small request.

389
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,005
Shinzaemon:
Which is?

390
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,758
Pay me 200 ryo up front.

391
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:03,845
Kuranaga:
You're only joining for the money?

392
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:08,642
Let me be clear. My sympathy with your
cause has nothing to do with money.

393
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:14,731
With no relationship or debts to you,
do you expect me to work for free?

394
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,318
How will you use the money?

395
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:26,368
The first 120 ryo for lifelong debts,
plus something nice for my relatives.

396
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:30,330
Thirty ryo for a tomb for my wife,
who died from my hardships.

397
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,083
Twenty for my preparations
as well.

398
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,543
And the rest?

399
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:41,591
To experience the "luxuries"
l never had in this life.

400
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,344


401
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:50,100
My kind of man.
His spirit is a bargain at 200.

402
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,061
Now, we're 1 1 .

403
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:58,066
Our quality outshines
our quantity.

404
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,155
Shinrokuro is here.

405
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:19,254
l'll take the odds
on your big gamble.

406
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,089
What do you wager?

407
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,384
lf it's a true gamble,
there's only one thing l can bet.

408
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:38,231
lf you refuse,
start by killing me now.

409
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:49,784


410
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,954
And now, we're 12!

411
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,421


412
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,802


413
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,433


414
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:18,646
No mercy! There's no samurai code
or fair play in battle!

415
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:29,324
No sword? Use a stick.
No stick? Use a rock.

416
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,869
No rock?
Use your fists and feet!

417
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:38,333
Lose your life,
but make the enemy pay!

418
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,586
Shinzaemon:
Horii.

419
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,631
Higuchi.

420
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:49,177
Train in explosives.

421
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,564


422
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,526


423
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,071
Sahara's voice:
Rest in peace.

424
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:12,867
I'll join you shortly.

425
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:21,126
Shinzaemon: Hurry up
with the preparations. We depart soon.

426
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:45,400
Lord Naritsugu
departs tomorrow.

427
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,402
Kuranaga:
Finally, he makes a move.

428
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,739
So where's
our best point of attack?

429
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:54,784
How about the Toda
boat crossing?

430
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:58,580
They'll send
half their men first.

431
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:02,417
The others will stand guard
as Naritsugu crosses.

432
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:07,088
Their troops split...
better to attack then.

433
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:12,302
No, they'll be on full alert.
Won't make any wrong moves.

434
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:18,349
Let's keep them anxious and running,
never knowing where we'll strike.

435
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,518
Hmm...

436
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:24,189
That's a good point to consider.

437
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,276
Hanbei:
Shinza? You here?

438
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,946
lt's Hanbei Kito
of the Akashi clan.

439
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,663
Shinza!

440
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,257
Hanbei.
l knew you'd come.

441
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,303
Glad to see you.

442
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,766
Hanbei:
I thought you had left already.

443
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,100


444
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:04,354
lf we had time,
l'd enjoy a match of go.

445
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,565
l still lead in wins.

446
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:11,277
Leave our score aside
until we meet again.

447
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,988
Again?

448
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:19,369
For years l envied you: a man from
a good family, close to the Shogun...

449
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,871
appointed to his elite guards.

450
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:28,461
After you moved up,
l commanded the same post.

451
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:35,260
To catch up,
l joined Lord Naritsugu.

452
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:41,599
He earned a fortune
when he was adopted by the Akashi.

453
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:48,147
That led me into this situation.

454
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:51,985
What an ill twist of fate.

455
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:57,615
Shinzaemon:
Perhaps we both embraced fate.

456
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:00,785
A samurai leads a helpless life.

457
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:08,001
Hanbei: Mamiya should've committed
harakiri in front of his Lord.

458
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:11,629
l once had that intention...

459
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:19,804
but l could not betray his father,
the former Shogun.

460
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,310
l lost my chance to move ahead.

461
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:28,813
l regret not beating you.

462
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:33,026
l was unable to commit harakiri.

463
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:41,117
As a samurai, l'll do
what must be done for the people.

464
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,830
For the people?

465
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:55,840
A samurai must do but one thing.
Serve his master, correct?

466
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:08,519
What an ill twist of fate.

467
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:15,151
lt's a long road
to the Akashi domain.

468
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,195
See you there.

469
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,364
Bet on it.

470
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:30,166


471
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,587


472
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,436
Edo

473
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:58,569


474
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:17,463


475
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,564
Shinrokuro's voice:
Uncle, three days have passed

476
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:37,066
since Naritsugu left Edo.

477
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,988
Where do we make our stand?

478
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,828
Hanbei's voice:
How wiII Shinza make his move?

479
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,524
We kept you waiting.

480
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:26,741
The verdict is out.
Brothers, we take Lord Naritsugu at...

481
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:33,289
Ochiai in the Mino province.

482
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,500
Ochiai

483
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:42,256
Naritsugu offended the Owari
by killing Makino's son in Kiso.

484
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:49,138
We can enlist Makino's help at Kiso.

485
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:52,850
Ask him to sign a non-transit act
using Lord Owari's name...

486
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:56,270
to ban Naritsugu from passing.

487
00:46:56,438 --> 00:47:02,151
He'll join us due to the murder
of his son and daughter-in-law.

488
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,569
And then?

489
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,072
Shinzaemon:
Only two possible routes.

490
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:11,536
The Kiso Pass
or the Kamizaka Pass.

491
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:16,415
Either way,
he must pass via Ochiai.

492
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:21,003
We'll fortify Ochiai
and strike hard.

493
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:28,386
What if they forgo appearances
and don't pay respect to the Naegi clan?

494
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:33,558
There's a chance they may not stop.

495
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:36,894
Shinzaemon:
But l wager they will.

496
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:42,859
Shinzaemon: With 12 men
challenging a bigger enemy...

497
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:49,782
no matter how much we plan,
we must have faith in luck.

498
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,619
We pick here and risk it all.

499
00:47:54,997 --> 00:48:01,043
With heaven's will,
the dice say Ochiai.

500
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,755


501
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,174
Risk it all!

502
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:12,305
Kuranaga, you're best suited
to get Makino's assistance.

503
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:16,642
Leave it to me.
l'll get that road blocked.

504
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,811
- Take lshizuka with you.
- l'm grateful.

505
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,647
- Let's get moving.

506
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,649
Excuse us.

507
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,278
Shinzaemon:
Mitsuhashi, ready the horses.

508
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,614
Ready and waiting, sir.

509
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:35,995
Shinzaemon: Go on ahead and negotiate
with the Mayor of Ochiai.

510
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:41,542
Give him these orders
from Sir Doi.

511
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:45,504
Understood.
How should l proceed?

512
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:48,007
Buy them all out.

513
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,636
Yes, sir.

514
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,220
- Shinzaemon: Let's ride!

515
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:58,643
Fast and hard
to pass the enemy!

516
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,813


517
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,149


518
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,626


519
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,198


520
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:26,230
You Shinzaemon Shimada?

521
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,400
ln the flesh.

522
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,736
Are you Akashi henchmen?

523
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,991


524
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,483


525
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,713
Don't follow them!

526
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:35,091
Anyone hurt?

527
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,259


528
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:43,390
That Hanbei,
he drew first blood.

529
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:47,269
Probably put coins in the hands
of these broke ronin.

530
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:52,274
Not a real attack.
His aim was to break our strength.

531
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,909
First time you killed as well?

532
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:06,497
l've fenced with real blades
many times but...

533
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:09,708
killing a man is a first.

534
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:20,928
There's only one road,
but we don't know where they'll strike.

535
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:25,057
lf they attack harder next time,
we could get hurt.

536
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:31,397
Let's accept
Hanbei's welcome.

537
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:39,864
And we'll vanish as well.

538
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,824
Huh?

539
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,810

540
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:13,814
Hioki's got
some new friends!

541
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:19,612
- Hioki: Disgusting!

542
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:25,117


543
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:30,122


544
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:34,335


545
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:47,765
Sahara: We'll travel northwest along
the ridge and cut through the valley,

546
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:52,186
over the mountain to Owari territory.

547
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:58,692
l had strict monastic training
when l was young in the mountains.

548
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:05,532
The mountain brings blessings
but its true nature is fear itself.

549
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,452
l see.

550
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:12,790


551
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:21,340
We are nobodies.

552
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:23,634
Huh?

553
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:29,890
He's right. No titles,
no affiliations. Nobodies.

554
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,731


555
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,323


556
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,097
A buyout?

557
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,433
Mitsuhashi:
That is our wish.

558
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:17,146
l won't go against
Sir Doi's orders.

559
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:21,442
But convincing the town
will be hard.

560
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:23,777


561
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:27,865


562
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,122
What?

563
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:39,293
Our deposit. Not enough?

564
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:43,422


565
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:50,179
Sahara:
The forest grows thicker.

566
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:54,016
Shinzaemon:
Hirayama, we're lost.

567
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,811
Sahara: Perhaps we should have
detoured at that cliff?

568
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:00,856
- Hirayama: That can't be.
- Sahara: But...

569
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,779


570
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,867
Who are you?

571
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:15,954
A bandit?
Or a raccoon goblin?

572
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:19,833
Do l look like a raccoon?

573
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,710


574
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,962
Ouch!

575
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,888


576
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,974
Couldn't lower me down, idiot!?

577
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,310
At least thank me.

578
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:43,273
You from these parts?

579
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,486
- Do l look so?
- Hirayama: lnsolent!

580
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,707
Ah-hh!

581
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:05,712
l ain't no ghost or bandit.

582
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:11,009
l hunt beasts
from mountain to mountain.

583
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:14,096
Any men with you?

584
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,808
Gone. 'Cause l laid
my hands on Upashi.

585
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,519
Upashi?

586
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,106
The boss's woman.

587
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,482


588
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:29,862
So he punished you.
Fools are the same wherever you go.

589
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,739
Hold your tongue!

590
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:35,701
- Got a name, son?

591
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,454
Koyata Kiga.

592
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:42,207
My ancestors were defeated warriors,
legitimate samurai stock.

593
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:45,335


594
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,213
What's so funny?

595
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:52,843
The name's Shinzaemon.
And these are my men.

596
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:57,514
What are samurai
doing out here?

597
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:02,394
A shortcut
made us lose our way.

598
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:10,736
l'll be your guide,
if you got food.

599
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:16,700
Deal?

600
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,838


601
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:33,258
- What's that?

602
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:36,762
Don't like bugs?
Watch.

603
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,852
Don't be a little girl!

604
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,854
What?

605
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,399


606
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,948
Let's go.

607
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,537
What now?

608
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,123
Hmm?

609
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:20,389


610
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,433

611
00:59:27,438 --> 00:59:29,690


612
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,821
Leave the rabbit.

613
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,616
We have important
work to do.

614
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,202
More important
than roast rabbit?

615
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:48,667

Sir Hanbei!

616
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,210
What is it?

617
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,420
Emergency.

618
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:54,089
Lord Naritsugu's passage
is banned.

619
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:56,675
Hanbei:
His passage is banned?

620
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,934
What's the matter?

621
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:19,031
You fools, will you stand idly by
at this humiliation?

622
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,125


623
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,462
Lord Owari is
from the top three clans.

624
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:37,799
But l am the son
of the former Shogun

625
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:41,762
and brother
to the current Shogun.

626
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:43,305
Cross over!

627
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,931
Hanbei:
Watch and learn.

628
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:50,145
We must go through Owari land.
Can our Lord swallow his pride?

629
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:54,483
Let's see if he gets his way
as he usuaIIy does.

630
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:00,989
Naritsugu:
Who are you?

631
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,660
ldentify yourself.

632
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,332
Out of my way...

633
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:14,086
or l'll kill you without mercy.

634
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:17,756
Last April...

635
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:20,926
in Kiso, you killed my son...

636
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:26,682
Uneme Makino and his wife.
l am Yukie Makino.

637
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,854
Does daddy monkey
have hard bones too?

638
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,109
My Lord!

639
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:44,366
Hanbei?

640
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:49,329
Leave this.
Let's go back.

641
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:02,884
Hanbei:
Owari only banned Lord Naritsugu.

642
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:08,223
His entourage can enter.
They are Akashi members.

643
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,350
l see.

644
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:12,561
The rest will guard our Lord.

645
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:16,523
lf people hear Owari blocked us...

646
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:20,902
if we don't visit the Naegi,
our Lord will be ridiculed.

647
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,530
Let them laugh.

648
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:27,075
Within a year, our Lord
will be second-in-command.

649
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:34,583
You risk his life and the Akashi clan
by visiting the Naegi.

650
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:39,921
You seem most afraid
of Shinzaemon.

651
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:43,842
What can that weak
Shogun servant do?

652
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:48,430
Since paying off the ronin,
there's no sign of him.

653
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:51,767
Perhaps he fears our clan
and ran?

654
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:57,647
Don't you see? He's the one
who blocked our passage.

655
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:08,867
Naritsugu: Do you cling to your life so
as to make me a laughing stock?

656
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:12,579
Hanbei: Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

657
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:19,920
l hear any samurai would choose death
over making his Lord a laughing stock.

658
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,558
Choose the foolish path.

659
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:39,397
lt's more fun that way.

660
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:45,737
Naritsugu:
Let's go, Hanbei.

661
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,907
- Hanbei: Move out!

662
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:59,876


663
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:27,612


664
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:57,601


665
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:02,898
We've had enough.

666
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,816
Koyata:
Hmm?

667
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:10,030
- Huh?

668
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:21,082
Oh, the road.

669
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:29,507
The road!

670
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,397
- Kuranaga: Welcome. Been expecting you.
- Shinzaemon: You've prepared well.

671
01:05:44,565 --> 01:05:46,399
Progress couldn't be better.

672
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:48,860
Shinzaemon:
Did it work?

673
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:55,200
Makino stopped them perfectly.
Naritsugu diverted his troops.

674
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:56,409
Shinzaemon:
Well, well.

675
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:58,119
Our long shot paid off.

676
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,580
Shinzaemon:
How many men with Naritsugu?

677
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,415
Kuranaga:
Seventy men.

678
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:04,960
Shinzaemon:
And Makino?

679
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:11,216
Kuranaga: He left nothing to chance.
He chose the path of harakiri.

680
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:16,763
He took full blame,
left no evidence behind.

681
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:18,098


682
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:20,433
He's a mighty samurai.

683
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:27,732
We must achieve
our mission for him.

684
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,319

Hey!

685
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,575
Got dinner!

686
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:39,911
Who is he?

687
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,790
He dropped in
when we entered the forest.

688
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,750
Dropped in?

689
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:52,924
Set a trap here
using this rock wall.

690
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,684
This alley
is a hard nut to crack.

691
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:09,190
Shinrokuro, what do you see?

692
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,609
Shinrokuro: Looks like
an ordinary boarding town.

693
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:13,319
Kuranaga:
lt is.

694
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:18,700
So we'll transform it
into a town of death.

695
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:21,161
Mitsuhashi,
get busy with the preparations.

696
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:22,495


697
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:25,040
Send lshizuka to keep watch.

698
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,083


699
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,849
- Koyata: Upashi.

700
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:46,394


701
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:49,439


702
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,069
Miss home?

703
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:58,823
l miss Upashi.

704
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,743
ls she that fine?

705
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:09,709
Like no woman
you've ever seen.

706
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:18,218
Soon, this quiet town
will become a bloodbath.

707
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:21,221
Go home alive while you can.

708
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:23,348


709
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,266
l got no home.

710
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:29,312
This is our fight.
You're not a samurai.

711
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:36,694
Don't trifle with your life.
Got it?

712
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,117
Damn samurai!

713
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:48,206
You and your honor
and causes!

714
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,710

l'll show you!

715
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:00,927
Vanished?

716
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:04,931
Lord Naritsugu passed through
Komagane along the lna road.

717
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:09,310
Then he vanished.

718
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:11,646
Back to Edo?

719
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,941
Not possible
with Naritsugu in control.

720
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:20,113
l'm concerned he'll cut through
to the Sanshu road and skip lida.

721
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:23,324
Without visiting the Naegi clan?

722
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:26,661
Shinzaemon:
Stand down.

723
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:29,956
Now, the playing field is level.

724
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:34,335
Hanbei is trying to ascertain
our next move.

725
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:39,257
We wait here.
Prepare for battle.

726
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,426


727
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:46,931
Batten down that side.

728
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:49,934


729
01:10:00,988 --> 01:10:03,323
Yes! Put it there.

730
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:34,437
Shinzaemon: If they don't show today,
they must have gone to Okazaki.

731
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:37,232
Kuranaga:
Another route?

732
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:40,860
Mitsuhashi:
Waiting is killing our chances.

733
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:44,280
Let's abandon Ochiai tonight.

734
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:48,451
We can cross the pass
to the Sanshu Road.

735
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:53,039
Shinzaemon, it's time to decide!

736
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:56,084
- Too soon.
- But...

737
01:10:57,294 --> 01:11:01,506
Do you know
the secret to fishing?

738
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:08,263
Wait until the fish
swallows the hook.

739
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,723
Reel it in when it swallows.
lt's simple.

740
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:18,940
But if you reel in too soon,
the fish will escape with the bait.

741
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,483


742
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:25,280
So you say
the Akashi are close?

743
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:31,119
With Hanbei at Naritsugu's side,
there is a chance...

744
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:33,329
they might skip the Naegi.

745
01:11:33,497 --> 01:11:36,291
Their numbers are not Iike ours.

746
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:39,877
Even if they went off the road...

747
01:11:40,045 --> 01:11:46,134
70 men cannot travel
without being noticed.

748
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:53,933
They must be in one place,
awaiting our next move.

749
01:11:54,101 --> 01:11:56,894
And if this is so?

750
01:11:57,062 --> 01:12:01,065
They'll come
if they think it's safe.

751
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:06,738
Shinzaemon: We wait
untiI the fish swaIIows the hook.

752
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:16,289
( distant hoofbeats
rumbIing )

753
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:23,421
They're here!

754
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:25,923
They're here!

755
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:28,009

They're coming!

756
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,595
The Akashi men are coming!

757
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:32,055
From where?

758
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:37,852
Along the Ohira road.
But there are not 70.

759
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,020
What?

760
01:12:41,565 --> 01:12:45,276
Many more. Over 200!

761
01:12:45,444 --> 01:12:46,611
Two hundred?

762
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:11,636
Hanbei! He bought time and summoned
troops from other areas!

763
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:15,056
Twelve men can never defeat 200.

764
01:13:17,351 --> 01:13:23,106
So what! As for the fish that takes
the hook, the bigger, the better.

765
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:33,408
Heaven's will brought us
all together.

766
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:42,917
Thirteen.

767
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:53,970
The time has come to lay down
your lives for the greater cause.

768
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,724
Are you ready?

769
01:13:58,892 --> 01:14:00,852
Ready to die?

770
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:02,812
All:
Yes!

771
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:01,787
Shinzaemon:
Take your posts!

772
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:25,394
Hanbei:
Halt!

773
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:30,149
Asakawa, wait here.

774
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:32,193
Let me through.

775
01:16:01,139 --> 01:16:03,224


776
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,269


777
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,522
Move out!

778
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:00,948
Naritsugu: How much longer
to Nakatsugawa?

779
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:02,533


780
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:05,453
Tell me how far!

781
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,788


782
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:19,342
Naritsugu:
What's the matter?

783
01:17:19,509 --> 01:17:20,801
Hanbei:
Oh no!

784
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:22,803
- My Lord!

785
01:17:23,805 --> 01:17:25,806


786
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:30,728
Turn back! My Lord!

787
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,418


788
01:18:02,844 --> 01:18:05,012


789
01:18:08,934 --> 01:18:11,811
What fun.
l'm going in, Hanbei!

790
01:18:14,314 --> 01:18:17,066
My Lord! Follow him!

791
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:23,239
lshizuka:
Hey!

792
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:27,743
You can get past this way.

793
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:31,706
This way, this way.

794
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,460


795
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,424


796
01:18:41,591 --> 01:18:43,551


797
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,178


798
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:51,350


799
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:55,187


800
01:19:01,027 --> 01:19:03,529


801
01:19:32,893 --> 01:19:34,518
Shinzaemon.

802
01:19:34,686 --> 01:19:40,900
l presume you are the Akashi entourage
of Lord Naritsugu.

803
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:48,240
By the order of His Shogun's subject,
Shinzaemon...

804
01:19:48,408 --> 01:19:52,453
we commemorate your passage
with arrows!

805
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:56,624
Hanbei:
My Lord!

806
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:00,795
My Lord!

807
01:20:02,589 --> 01:20:04,715
Leave the horses.
Protect our Lord.

808
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:10,304

809
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:19,021


810
01:20:26,863 --> 01:20:29,198


811
01:20:35,705 --> 01:20:38,707


812
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:07,778
My Lord.

813
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:20,082
Come this way.

814
01:21:21,084 --> 01:21:22,585
Please wait.

815
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:24,086
Secure the interior.

816
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:27,256
- Huh?
- Secure the interior.

817
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:30,259
Hey, secure the interior.

818
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:37,558


819
01:21:38,602 --> 01:21:40,603


820
01:21:46,192 --> 01:21:48,235


821
01:21:57,704 --> 01:22:00,623


822
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,929


823
01:22:18,475 --> 01:22:20,935
Enough petty tricks.

824
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:31,403
Only 130 left!

825
01:22:31,571 --> 01:22:34,323
What you paid for my life...

826
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:36,575
was a real bargain.

827
01:22:38,536 --> 01:22:42,414
The enemy is not large!
Don't panic.

828
01:22:42,582 --> 01:22:45,376
Show them the spirit
of Akashi samurai!

829
01:22:45,543 --> 01:22:50,005
Trade your lives
to protect our Lord.

830
01:22:50,173 --> 01:22:53,175


831
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:11,986
My Lord!

832
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:14,154
Lord!

833
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:27,960
TOTAL MASSACRE

834
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:47,563
Kill! Kill them all!

835
01:23:47,731 --> 01:23:50,524


836
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,618


837
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:25,225


838
01:26:02,073 --> 01:26:04,533


839
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,626
Ogura!

840
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:36,732
Samurai:
Fire? No, no!

841
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:40,152


842
01:26:48,912 --> 01:26:50,746


843
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:59,129


844
01:27:15,146 --> 01:27:18,148
My Lord!
l found a way out!

845
01:27:25,949 --> 01:27:28,450
No! lt's a trap.

846
01:27:32,163 --> 01:27:33,789
My Lord.

847
01:27:40,838 --> 01:27:42,422
Come!

848
01:27:57,981 --> 01:27:59,982


849
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:06,029


850
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,330
Hioki!

851
01:28:25,508 --> 01:28:27,092
Guide:
Go, go!

852
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:28,802
This way, my Lord.

853
01:28:45,194 --> 01:28:47,946


854
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:07,758
Look.

855
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:38,121
Ogura, kill the men
that get past me.

856
01:29:38,289 --> 01:29:40,916
Don't leave one alive.

857
01:29:41,084 --> 01:29:42,918
Yes, master.

858
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:48,799
Kill!

859
01:29:48,966 --> 01:29:51,093


860
01:30:25,586 --> 01:30:28,463


861
01:30:33,553 --> 01:30:36,555


862
01:30:44,021 --> 01:30:45,981


863
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:48,150


864
01:30:53,906 --> 01:30:55,282


865
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:56,825
Hirayama:
Retreat.

866
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:03,165
Ogura!

867
01:31:38,576 --> 01:31:41,077
Koyata: Your samurai brawls
are crazy fun.

868
01:31:41,245 --> 01:31:43,538
lshizuka:
lt's no brawl!

869
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:48,668
Why are you samurai
so arrogant?

870
01:31:51,964 --> 01:31:54,090
Why are you samurai...

871
01:31:54,258 --> 01:31:58,386
so arrogant?

872
01:32:09,148 --> 01:32:11,066
Higuchi, you okay?

873
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:15,153
Thanks.

874
01:32:37,009 --> 01:32:39,052
Hioki!

875
01:32:53,234 --> 01:32:55,193


876
01:32:58,698 --> 01:33:00,574


877
01:33:17,717 --> 01:33:19,175
Hioki...

878
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:24,681
you fought well.
A true samurai.

879
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:27,726


880
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:31,146
Shinzaemon.

881
01:33:33,691 --> 01:33:35,483
Higuchi!

882
01:34:03,137 --> 01:34:05,764
- Go!
- Finish the job.

883
01:34:05,931 --> 01:34:08,308
- Otake: lshizuka!

884
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:20,195
lshizuka!

885
01:34:27,536 --> 01:34:29,204

Otake.

886
01:34:31,082 --> 01:34:35,126
Our mission...

887
01:34:35,294 --> 01:34:39,172
finish it!

888
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:47,931
Shinzaemon!

889
01:34:58,192 --> 01:35:00,110


890
01:35:26,971 --> 01:35:28,722


891
01:35:31,350 --> 01:35:32,976
Mitsuhashi!

892
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:38,732


893
01:35:43,863 --> 01:35:46,448
Damn!

894
01:35:52,246 --> 01:35:54,080
Mitsuhashi!

895
01:36:00,087 --> 01:36:02,839


896
01:36:12,516 --> 01:36:14,726


897
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:19,272


898
01:36:20,691 --> 01:36:22,692


899
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:24,694


900
01:36:25,946 --> 01:36:27,530


901
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:43,046


902
01:36:48,677 --> 01:36:51,387


903
01:36:54,683 --> 01:36:56,559
You fool!

904
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:03,483
- Hanbei.

905
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:06,736
You think the age of war
was like this?

906
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:09,697
Perhaps.

907
01:37:11,325 --> 01:37:14,118
lt's magnificent.

908
01:37:16,705 --> 01:37:21,167
With death
comes gratitude for life.

909
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:26,297
lf a man has lived in vain,
then how trivial his life is.

910
01:37:29,426 --> 01:37:32,637
Oh, Hanbei.

911
01:37:32,805 --> 01:37:34,472
Something wonderful
has come to my mind.

912
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:36,641


913
01:37:37,768 --> 01:37:40,478
Once l'm
on the Shogun's council,

914
01:37:40,646 --> 01:37:44,190
let's bring back the age of war.

915
01:37:47,319 --> 01:37:50,154


916
01:38:14,847 --> 01:38:17,056


917
01:38:20,352 --> 01:38:29,110


918
01:38:31,655 --> 01:38:36,242
l'm Saheita Kuranaga.

919
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:38,494
Lord Naritsugu...

920
01:38:38,662 --> 01:38:41,789
l've come for your life.

921
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:46,961
Sir Hanbei...

922
01:38:47,129 --> 01:38:51,424
protect our Lord.

923
01:38:55,387 --> 01:38:56,721


924
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:15,114


925
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:24,123
Comrade:
Kuranaga!

926
01:40:13,924 --> 01:40:15,383
My Lord!

927
01:40:31,775 --> 01:40:34,027


928
01:40:48,625 --> 01:40:51,794


929
01:40:54,089 --> 01:40:56,257


930
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:35,838


931
01:41:38,050 --> 01:41:39,425


932
01:41:39,593 --> 01:41:41,761


933
01:41:47,768 --> 01:41:50,520


934
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:54,273


935
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:09,288
Master...

936
01:42:14,753 --> 01:42:16,754


937
01:42:40,404 --> 01:42:43,072
Who are you?

938
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:46,659
You're no samurai!

939
01:42:46,827 --> 01:42:49,662
So what?

940
01:42:56,086 --> 01:42:58,254
Do only samurai matter
in this world?

941
01:43:04,636 --> 01:43:07,221
l thought
samurai would be fun...

942
01:43:07,389 --> 01:43:08,598


943
01:43:08,765 --> 01:43:10,641
but you bore me.

944
01:43:11,685 --> 01:43:17,231
You're useless,
even more useless in great numbers.

945
01:43:18,233 --> 01:43:20,234


946
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:24,572


947
01:43:37,961 --> 01:43:40,630
This man speaks the truth.

948
01:43:40,797 --> 01:43:44,300
His reward is my short sword.

949
01:43:45,302 --> 01:43:48,221
lf we can get past that...

950
01:43:49,223 --> 01:43:53,184
Remain focused.
Victory is ours!

951
01:43:53,352 --> 01:43:56,687
Keep our Lord safe.
We'll win!

952
01:43:56,855 --> 01:43:58,689


953
01:44:09,243 --> 01:44:12,078


954
01:44:14,665 --> 01:44:17,500


955
01:44:38,021 --> 01:44:40,856


956
01:44:43,277 --> 01:44:44,610
My Lord!

957
01:44:45,612 --> 01:44:47,863
Let's run.

958
01:44:49,283 --> 01:44:53,744
Hanbei,
victory is not yet ours.

959
01:45:05,799 --> 01:45:07,550


960
01:45:08,635 --> 01:45:11,220
Shinza.

961
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:22,148
Hanbei, l have no qualms
with you.

962
01:45:24,318 --> 01:45:27,069
You will not pass.

963
01:45:27,237 --> 01:45:31,198
l'll trade my life
to protect my Lord.

964
01:45:33,076 --> 01:45:35,619
l must do
what must be done.

965
01:45:36,830 --> 01:45:41,250
Are you so hungry
for my Lord's life?

966
01:45:41,418 --> 01:45:43,753
Yes!

967
01:45:44,838 --> 01:45:52,094
l gambled my life in this senseless war
of power and politics.

968
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:56,599
lf he joins the Shogun's council...

969
01:45:56,767 --> 01:46:02,897
you know disaster
will befall the people!

970
01:46:03,065 --> 01:46:05,858
- Am l wrong?
- So what then?

971
01:46:07,027 --> 01:46:11,113
Both you and l
were born samurai.

972
01:46:11,281 --> 01:46:12,990
Ours is not to wonder why.

973
01:46:13,158 --> 01:46:15,451
Ours is...

974
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:18,996
to obey our fate and die.

975
01:46:20,665 --> 01:46:23,209
Shinzaemon:
If you were my ally...

976
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:28,047
if you were not
an Akashi retainer...

977
01:46:29,341 --> 01:46:31,175
wouIdn't our task be easier?

978
01:46:31,343 --> 01:46:33,844
Don't lecture me!

979
01:46:34,012 --> 01:46:38,516
No matter how low l go,
Hanbei Kito is a samurai!

980
01:46:38,683 --> 01:46:42,728
l won't hand over
my Lord's head so easily.

981
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:52,154
Shinza...

982
01:46:53,865 --> 01:46:57,493
to pass,
you'll have to kill me.

983
01:47:04,084 --> 01:47:05,418
That l shall do.

984
01:47:05,585 --> 01:47:07,878


985
01:47:08,046 --> 01:47:09,755
Fight!

986
01:47:20,767 --> 01:47:24,019
Such elegance in fighting
one-on-one.

987
01:47:31,111 --> 01:47:33,779


988
01:47:43,248 --> 01:48:00,097


989
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:10,816
How l missed
crossing swords with you!

990
01:48:16,823 --> 01:48:18,574

Hanbei...

991
01:48:19,576 --> 01:48:23,496
in the dojo,
we were an even match.

992
01:48:27,626 --> 01:48:29,752


993
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:40,179
Hanbei...

994
01:48:41,515 --> 01:48:43,682
see you in hell!

995
01:48:52,776 --> 01:48:55,402


996
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:10,167


997
01:49:18,385 --> 01:49:20,553
Some call it elegance.

998
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:25,224
Some call it cruel and unfair.

999
01:49:25,392 --> 01:49:27,726
l like it.

1000
01:49:44,744 --> 01:49:47,746


1001
01:49:57,090 --> 01:50:01,844
How can you kick his head?

1002
01:50:02,012 --> 01:50:04,179
He gave his life for you!

1003
01:50:06,099 --> 01:50:09,101
Kick my head if you want.

1004
01:50:17,819 --> 01:50:23,616
For the Shogun, for the people,
for the many who died untimely deaths...

1005
01:50:23,783 --> 01:50:26,076
for Uneme Makino and his wife...

1006
01:50:26,244 --> 01:50:30,623
for his father, Yukie Makino...

1007
01:50:31,833 --> 01:50:35,461
and for my men scattering Ochiai.

1008
01:50:36,463 --> 01:50:38,213
For that...

1009
01:50:39,215 --> 01:50:43,260
innocent, nameless young girl...

1010
01:50:43,428 --> 01:50:46,430
with severed arms and legs...

1011
01:50:48,308 --> 01:50:51,310
l shall take your life!

1012
01:50:52,896 --> 01:50:55,397
Ruling is convenient...

1013
01:50:55,565 --> 01:50:58,484
but only for rulers.

1014
01:50:59,486 --> 01:51:02,613
The people must live to serve.

1015
01:51:04,741 --> 01:51:10,954
Even so, a time comes when servants
rise up against their Lords.

1016
01:51:14,209 --> 01:51:18,253
You're on top
thanks to support from the bottom.

1017
01:51:18,421 --> 01:51:20,255
Shinzaemon:
Don't you see?

1018
01:51:28,682 --> 01:51:32,643
Shinzaemon:
Your mistake is believing

1019
01:51:32,811 --> 01:51:37,189
that your decorative blade
is not just for show.

1020
01:51:37,357 --> 01:51:41,151
Nonsense.
lt's not for show!

1021
01:51:41,319 --> 01:51:45,823
Decoration is for show.

1022
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:50,619
Be silent
like the decorative man you are.

1023
01:51:52,706 --> 01:51:54,707

Servant!

1024
01:51:54,874 --> 01:51:57,876


1025
01:51:59,462 --> 01:52:02,005
How is this for show?

1026
01:52:05,677 --> 01:52:06,927


1027
01:52:07,095 --> 01:52:09,346


1028
01:52:15,019 --> 01:52:17,438


1029
01:52:27,907 --> 01:52:29,783
Uncle!

1030
01:52:30,785 --> 01:52:34,788


1031
01:52:34,956 --> 01:52:36,290
Pain.

1032
01:52:41,337 --> 01:52:43,922


1033
01:52:48,219 --> 01:52:51,388
lt hurts!

1034
01:52:54,184 --> 01:52:57,060
That's unexpected.

1035
01:52:57,228 --> 01:52:59,563
Can you feel pain?

1036
01:53:01,858 --> 01:53:04,860
Am l dying?

1037
01:53:06,446 --> 01:53:08,781
Dying?

1038
01:53:14,287 --> 01:53:18,415

l'm scared. So scared.

1039
01:53:18,583 --> 01:53:19,750
Scared.

1040
01:53:21,294 --> 01:53:24,296
Scared.

1041
01:53:25,548 --> 01:53:27,758
l don't want...

1042
01:53:27,926 --> 01:53:29,635


1043
01:53:29,803 --> 01:53:32,429
to die.

1044
01:53:32,597 --> 01:53:34,723


1045
01:53:35,725 --> 01:53:36,809


1046
01:53:36,976 --> 01:53:39,561
l'm scared! l'm scared!

1047
01:53:46,069 --> 01:53:48,904


1048
01:53:53,076 --> 01:53:56,787
My Lord...
prepare yourself!

1049
01:53:56,955 --> 01:53:58,789


1050
01:54:02,001 --> 01:54:07,214

So death comes for us all.

1051
01:54:13,263 --> 01:54:19,142
Allow me to thank you,
Shinzaemon.

1052
01:54:28,444 --> 01:54:31,989
Of all the days of my life,

1053
01:54:32,156 --> 01:54:35,993
today has been
the most exciting.

1054
01:54:39,163 --> 01:54:41,081
You're welcome!

1055
01:54:41,249 --> 01:54:43,500


1056
01:54:46,087 --> 01:54:48,714


1057
01:54:52,343 --> 01:54:54,720
Shinzaemon:
It's over.

1058
01:54:59,601 --> 01:55:02,185
The big gamble paid off.

1059
01:55:02,353 --> 01:55:04,646


1060
01:55:09,694 --> 01:55:11,820
Shinrokuro...

1061
01:55:13,865 --> 01:55:16,491
being a samurai...

1062
01:55:17,994 --> 01:55:22,748
is truly a burden.

1063
01:55:28,546 --> 01:55:31,506
Do what you want...

1064
01:55:32,926 --> 01:55:35,427
with your life.

1065
01:55:46,439 --> 01:55:48,774


1066
01:56:54,924 --> 01:56:57,634


1067
01:57:13,026 --> 01:57:15,235
Shinrokuro:
Are you immortal?

1068
01:57:16,612 --> 01:57:19,406
You got the Lord's head
without me?

1069
01:57:21,325 --> 01:57:23,660
Our fight is over.

1070
01:57:25,413 --> 01:57:28,206
That ain't no fun.

1071
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:33,295
- You hurt?
- Hmm? Oh...

1072
01:57:33,463 --> 01:57:39,301
Compared to fighting a wild bear,
these wounds are nothing.

1073
01:57:42,805 --> 01:57:45,057
All in all...

1074
01:57:46,225 --> 01:57:48,727
l want my Upashi.

1075
01:57:53,357 --> 01:57:56,610
l don't like towns
swarming with samurai.

1076
01:57:57,653 --> 01:58:01,823
l'll go home,
sweep Upashi off her feet...

1077
01:58:01,991 --> 01:58:04,367
and live far away!

1078
01:58:05,745 --> 01:58:07,913
Live your life.

1079
01:58:10,792 --> 01:58:12,959
Till the next life!

1080
01:58:19,467 --> 01:58:21,802
What are you going to do?

1081
01:58:24,555 --> 01:58:28,558
Whatever l want.
Been a samurai long enough.

1082
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:33,063
Become a bandit.

1083
01:58:33,231 --> 01:58:35,649
The greatest bandit in Japan.

1084
01:58:35,817 --> 01:58:39,027
Jump ship to America,
make love to women.

1085
01:58:39,195 --> 01:58:42,823
Now you're talking.

1086
01:58:44,951 --> 01:58:47,285
Say "hi" to Upashi for me.

1087
01:58:51,999 --> 01:58:54,000
Sure.

1088
01:59:54,812 --> 01:59:57,147


1089
02:00:13,748 --> 02:00:16,082

( wood cracks,

1091
02:00:40,107 --> 02:00:43,443
ln May 1844,

1092
02:00:43,611 --> 02:00:46,905
it was reported
to the Central Government...

1093
02:00:47,073 --> 02:00:50,408
that Lord Naritsugu
fell ill and died.

1094
02:00:52,370 --> 02:00:56,373
Some 23 years later,
the Shogunate system was abolished.

1095
02:00:56,540 --> 02:00:59,084
